# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock paper scissors program using Java class and methods.

This program is the conversion of a python-based rock paper scissors program
to Java using using current knowledge of Java that encompasses this application.

Features such as ternary operators, switch / case statements,
utilizing the import of Scanner and Random class packages, if statements, while loops
method chaining and so on will be used as reference for future programs and applications.

This is for me to better understand the efficient use of code.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock paper scissors program using Java class and methods.

This program is me converting a rock paper scissors program from python
to Java using Java language class methods using the knowledge I currently have of Java
that encompasses this application.

Features such as ternary operators, switch / case statements,
utilizing the import of Scanner and Random class packages, if statements, while loops
method chaining and so on will be used as reference for future programs and applications.

For me to better understand the efficient use of code.
